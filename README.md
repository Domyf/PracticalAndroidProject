# COMP 41690 Practical Android Programming 2019/20

### Introduction

The Mobile Apps industry has grown from nothing over the past ten years into a venture worth tens of billions worldwide. It is therefore useful to have some experience of developing for smartphone platforms, as a way of better understanding this industry, or to gain experience that recruiters will value if you aim to work in these areas. The coursework requires you to explore the challenges of developing applications for the Android platforms. The primary goal is to gain a better understanding of how to develop applications for phone handsets that contain a range of sensors. The coursework will also help you develop an understanding of how to design effective user interfaces for mobile devices, how to display sensor data  and how to use the media capabilities of modern smartphones.


### The App

You will develop an App for the Android platform that demonstrates innovative and exciting use of mobile sensors and the media capabilities of Android phones. **_The App must focus on some aspect of sustainability._** At a minimum it should include the following basic requirements:

1. It must make use of a range of user interface elements, e.g. lists, buttons, spinners, dialogues, an
    action bar, Toasts etc.
2. It must include at least seven distinct screens (Activities).
3. It must store data locally, e.g. in an SQLLite database. Remote storage is also allowed, but some
    element of local storage is a requirement.
4. It must make good use of at least two sensors (e.g. motion or location sensors) or web services
    (e.g. the Open Weather Map [http://openweathermap.org/).](http://openweathermap.org/).)
5. It should connect with and use at least one Activity from another Android application, e.g. email,
    maps, contacts.

Alongside these requirements your application should be robust and integrate well with the Android environment. For example, it should be able to handle being interrupted by an incoming call and manage system resources in an efficient manner. The design and visual presentation of your application is also important. For example, it should make use of a consistent style/theme and be intuitive to use. It should also provide appropriate representations of sensor or web service data, reflecting the properties of the data used and the requirements of your target users.


### The app will be marked based on the following criteria:

- Minimum requirements (40%) – for supplying the project files (source code etc.) and meeting the minimum requirements. Your app should work without runtime errors.
- Quality of the user interface (20%)
- Overall quality and complexity (25%) – What is the level of technical complexity? Does your app function well and robustly? What extra features does it include beyond the basic requirements?
- Innovation and originality ( 15 %) – How innovative and original is your app? Does it explore exciting new ideas regarding the capabilities and uses of mobile phones? Does it make innovative use of the sensor and media features of modern smartphones?
